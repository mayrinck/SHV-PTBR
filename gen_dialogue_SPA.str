[ALX041]Ahhh. de novo n�o... ahh..
[ALX042]Ai!  Ack..
[ALX043]Grrr... ahhhh...
[ALX044]Que?  Como eu cheguei aqui?  O que est� acontecendo?
[ALX045]Nossa, que estranho... Por que estou aqui agora?
[ALX046]Eu odeio aquilo.
[ALX047]Mas que porra foi aquilo?!
[ALX048]Bem que eu poderia parar de ter dor de cabe�a... Que saco...
[ALX049]Aquilo foi bem estranho...
[ALX100]Bom.
[ALX102]Legal.
[ALX104]Bacana.
[ALX106]Precisava disso.
[ALX108]Isso pode ajudar.
[ALX110]Precisava disso.
[ALX112]Uh-huh.
[ALX114]Hmmm.
[ALX116]Sim.
[ALX118]Beleza.
[ALX120]Entendido.
[ALX122]Entendido.
[ALX124]Feito.
[ALX126]Nem adianta.
[ALX128]Merda.
[ALX130]Negativo.
[ALX132]Arrgh.
[ALX134]N�o da pra passar agora.
[ALX136]N�o da pra passar, ainda...
[ALX138]Eu voltarei depois.
[ALX140]N�o... Talvez depois...
[ALX142]Vou tentar isso depois...
[ALX144]Eu nunca vou passar por aqui...
[ALX146]Se est� bloqueado, � por uma raz�o...
[ALX148]Preciso encontrar outro caminho...
[ALX150]Caminho errado.
[ALX152]Esque�a.
[ALX154]Abrace a dor, soldadinho... Abrace a dor, soldadinho...
[ALX156]Ser� que eu to ficando maluco!?
[ALX158]Minha mente ta zoando comigo?!
[ALX160]Isso � real?
[ALX162]Inacredit�vel.
[ALX164]O que foi isso?
[ALX166]Voc� ta ai?
[ALX168]Esquisito.
[ALX170]Parece perigoso.
[ALX172]Tudo certo.
[ALX174]Nada aqui.
[ALX176]Isso � estranho...
[ALX178]Onde aquilo foi?
[ALX180]Podia jurar que estava aqui...
[ALX182]Elle. Voc� est� bem?
[ALX184]Wheeler. Ta tudo bem?
[ALX186]M�e! Voc� ta aqui?
[ALX188]Tem algo ali.
[ALX190]Algo est� vindo.
[ALX192]O que � aquilo?
[ALX194]Eles de novo?
[ALX196]Soldados.
[ALX198]A Ordem?
[ALX200]Problema.
[ALX202]Conhe�o esse som...
[ALX204]Outra serra?
[ALX206]O que tem l� em baixo?
[ALX208]O que tem l� em cima?
[ALX210]Saiu de l�.
[ALX212]O que... �... Aquilo?
[ALX214]Meu Deus...
[ALX216]Mas o que?
[ALX218]Lobos...
[ALX220]Animais.
[ALX222]Algo est� rosnando...
[ALX224]Algo est� se mexendo...
[ALX226]Algo est� vindo...
[ALX228]Insetos?
[ALX230]Quem est� ai?
[ALX232]Ol�?
[ALX234]Elle?
[ALX236]Quem est� ai?
[ALX238]Ol�?
[ALX240]Elle?
[ALX242]O que � aquilo?
[ALX244]Something's clicking.
[ALX246]What's that sound?
[ALX248]Algo est� queimando...
[ALX250]N�o consigo respirar.
[ALX252]Que cheiro � esse?
[ALX254]Isso �... Metal?
[ALX256]Whatever that is, it's serious.
[ALX258]Ahhh merda!
[ALX260]Ol�.
[ALX262]OK.
[ALX264]Ah, cara.
[ALX266]Esses caras.
[ALX268]Soldados.
[ALX270]E l� vamos n�s.
[ALX272]Mas o que?
[ALX274]O que � voc�?
[ALX276]Ah, cara.
[ALX278]Meu Deus.
[ALX280]O que � aquilo?
[ALX282]Fica longe de mim!
[ALX284]�timo.
[ALX286]Aqui, cachorrinho!
[ALX288]Aqui, garoto!
[ALX290]Incoming.
[ALX292]Bugs.
[ALX294]Crap.
[ALX296]Who are you?
[ALX298]Hello?
[ALX300]Stay away from me.
[ALX302]What the hell are you?
[ALX304]Hello?
[ALX306]Don't come any closer!
[ALX308]What is that thing?
[ALX310]Oh God.
[ALX312]It's coming.
[ALX314]What's that smoke?
[ALX316]Is that on fire?
[ALX318]Don't breathe.
[ALX320]This ain't good.
[ALX322]Time to get a move on!
[ALX324]Take cover.
[ALX326]Not today!
[ALX328]C'mon, freak.
[ALX330]Let's do this.
[ALX332]Let's go!
[ALX334]You're dead.
[ALX336]Don't mess with me.
[ALX338]Come on!
[ALX340]You're going down.
[ALX342]C'mon.
[ALX344]Get some.
[ALX346]You want this?
[ALX348]Try and take me.
[ALX350]You want a piece of me?
[ALX352]You guys are all alike.
[ALX354]You want a fight?
[ALX356]You're not a REAL soldier!
[ALX358]Where are you?
[ALX360]I'm ready.
[ALX362]I'm gonna mess you up.
[ALX364]What are you?
[ALX366]Oh man.
[ALX368]Watch it!
[ALX370]Down, boy.
[ALX372]Bring some friends?
[ALX374]I don't think so.
[ALX376]Where'd you come from?
[ALX378]Where's my fly swatter?
[ALX380]Splat.
[ALX382]You are one ugly bitch.
[ALX384]Sorry about this.
[ALX386]This might sting a little!
[ALX388]Want a fight?
[ALX390]Think you're tough?
[ALX392]C'mon, big guy.
[ALX394]I'm taking you down.
[ALX396]Get down here.
[ALX398]I'm ready.
[ALX400]I don't really have anything else to ask.
[ALX401]I don't really think they can tell me anything else.
[ALX402]I don't think I'm gonna learn anything more here.
[ALX403]I should probably just talk to somebody else.
[ALX404]I think I've run out of things to ask.
[ALX405]I don't need to ask about this stuff.
[ALX406]I think I've asked enough questions.
[ALX407]It's time to stop asking questions and time to start taking action.
[ALX408]I think I've got just about all the information I can here.
[ALX409]I'm tired of asking questions.
[ALX410]Forget this.  I need to get going.
[ALX411]This is getting me nowhere.
[ALX412]This isn't helping.  I gotta go.
[ALX413]This is pointless.
[ALX414]I'm through with this.
[ALX415]I'm tired of talking.  I got things I have to do.
[ALX416]Forget it.  Sorry I asked.
[ALX417]Look...thanks, but this isn't helping.
[ALX418]This is taking forever.  I gotta go.
[ALX419]Sorry, but I can't get into all this.  I'll talk to you later.
[ALX620]Time to snuff you out.
[ALX622]Stay over there.
[ALX624]You're nothing!
[ALX626]You come for me?
[ALX628]Try and catch me.
[ALX630]Keep up, metal mouth.
[ALX632]Die.
[ALX634]Here!
[ALX636]Hurt much?
[ALX638]Feel this?
[ALX640]Here you go.
[ALX642]Say uncle.
[ALX644]Had enough?
[ALX646]How you like that?
[ALX648]This'll hurt.
[ALX650]Keep away!
[ALX652]Stay down!
[ALX654]Sharp, ain'tcha?
[ALX656]Need some more?
[ALX658]Eat this.
[ALX660]BANG!  Dead doggie!
[ALX662]Roll over.
[ALX664]Down!
[ALX666]Squish!
[ALX668]Bam.
[ALX670]Gotcha.
[ALX672]Bitch!
[ALX674]Back off.
[ALX676]Sorry, girls.
[ALX678]C'mon, die.
[ALX680]Don't even try it.
[ALX682]Turn around.
[ALX684]Hold still.
[ALX686]This may hurt.
[ALX688]Keep those things away from me.
[ALX690]Close up.
[ALX692]No smoking.
[ALX696]Won't die, will you?
[ALX698]Leave me alone!
[ALX700]Who are you?
[ALX702]Let go!
[ALX704]Stop.
[ALX706]Get away.
[ALX708]Back off!
[ALX710]Get off.
[ALX712]Confirmed kill.
[ALX714]Over and out.
[ALX716]Done.
[ALX718]Dead.
[ALX720]Who's next?
[ALX722]Gone.
[ALX724]Damn.
[ALX726]Yes.
[ALX728]Where should I send the flowers?
[ALX730]Your career's over.
[ALX732]You're finished.
[ALX734]Finally.
[ALX736]What was that thing?
[ALX740]Who was that?
[ALX742]Damn.
[ALX744]I can barely breathe.
[ALX746]It's over now.
[ALX748]It's finished.
[ALX750]Elle!
[ALX752]Over here!
[ALX754]Elle, help!
[ALX756]Little help.
[ALX758]Help!
[ALX760]Elle, I need you!
[ALX762]Wheeler!
[ALX764]Over here!
[ALX766]Wheeler!  Help!
[ALX768]Need some help.
[ALX770]Gimmie a hand!
[ALX772]I need some backup!
[ALX774]Ahh!
[ALX776]Did I see that?
[ALX778]Oh God.
[ALX780]Disgusting.
[ALX782]What happened to this poor guy?
[ALX784]Who was this?
[ALX786]Ahh!
[ALX788]Shit.
[ALX790]Whoa!
[ALX792]Ah!  What was that?!
[ALX794]There's no way I can get through this.
[ALX796]Maybe I've got something I can use here.
[ALX798]I've got nothing that'll cut through that.
[ALX800]Wonder what could cut through that.
[ALX802]Bet I could shoot that down.  Too bad.
[ALX804]A good shot should take that down.
[ALX806]I can cut right through this.
[ALX808]This just needs the right key.
[ALX810]I could figure this out if I had more to work with.
[ALX812]I can probably open this.
[ALX814]I bet I can push this.
[ALX816]What is this, a drug?
[ALX818]This'll pump me up.
[ALX820]Must be something good in here.
[ALX822]This is a start.
[ALX824]That'll wake you up.
[ALX826]It's carving time.
[ALX828]I can put this to better use.
[ALX830]Gotta keep my blades sharp.
[ALX832]This'll put a dent in someone's head.
[ALX834]Nice and heavy.
[ALX836]This'll do some serious damage.
[ALX838]That's what I'm talking about.
[ALX840]Everybody better get the hell outta my way.
[ALX842]Time to cut some bad guys down.
[ALX844]This'll split some skulls.
[ALX846]Nothing's getting in my way now.
[ALX848]I remember this.
[ALX850]Less reloading...
[ALX852]This'll keep things moving.
[ALX854]Now we're getting serious.
[ALX856]Time to mop the floors.
[ALX858]This'll stir things up a bit.
[ALX860]Rapid-fire.
[ALX862]Load 'em up.
[JOS300]Alex.
[JOS302]Alex.
[JOS304]Alex, over here.
[JOS306]Alex, follow me.
[JOS308]Follow me.
[JOS310]Over here.
[JOS312]Behind You.
