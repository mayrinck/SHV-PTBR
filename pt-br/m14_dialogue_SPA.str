[ALX095]You need to get him out of here.
[ALX096]I can't.  Not without Joshua.
[ALX097]You need to get out of here.
[ALX181]Bastards.
[ALX183]Stop it!
[ALX185]Damn it!
[ALX187]Por favor, pare!
[ALX189]Come on, move!
[ALX191]O que?
[ALX225]Oh meu Deus...
[ALX227]Então foi assim que eles fizeram tudo isso.
[ALX229]Como eles foram capazes?
[ALX597]Eu salvei sua vida!
[ALX598]Por que você está fazendo isso?!
[ALX599]How could you do this to me?  And to Elle?!
[ALX600]You think you're in control?  Your followers are just a bunch of mindless zombies.  They don't believe in any of this crazy bullshit.
[ALX601]What do you want from me?  To change?  To join you?  You're going to have to try a lot harder than that if you think I'd ever help you!
[ALX602]Okay.  Please, I've had enough.  I'll do it, I'll join.  Just, please, no more.
[CUR100]Sai logo dai!
[CUR102]Você näo pode se esconder.
[CUR104]Eu sei que você ta ai.
[CUR106]Eu to te ouvindo!
[CUR116]Eu näo tenho medo de você.
[CUR118]Vem aqui.
[CUR120]O que foi aquilo?
[CUR122]Você ta morto!
[CUR124]Seu filho de uma puta!
[CUR126]Diga adeus!
[CUR128]Te vejo no inferno.
[CUR130]Você mexeu com o cara errado.
[CUR132]Você vai pagar pela sua traiçäo.
[CUR134]Tire suas mäos de cima de mim!
[CUR136]Näo faça isso de novo!
[CUR138]Eu näo vou morrer täo fácil assim.
[CUR140]Esse é o preço que você vai pagar.
[CUR142]Fim de jogo.
[CUR144]Näo precisa ser assim.
[CUR146]Você teve uma escolha.  Você escolheu errado.
[ELE014]Alex!
[ELE016]Por aqui!
[ELE018]Socorro!  Alex!
[ELE020]Preciso de ajuda.
[ELE022]Onde você está?
[ELE024]Me ajuda aqui.
[ELE026]O que foi aquilo?
[ELE028]Quem está ai?
[ELE030]Alex, você ouviu isso?
[ELE032]Tem algo vindo.
[ELE054]Cuidado.
[ELE056]Fica longe!
[ELE058]Se afasta!
[ELE060]Oh não.
[ELE714]Mas e você?
[ELE715]Toma cuidado.  Não posso te perder também.
[JUD418]I didn't need saving.  I needed to lure you in.  I needed you to die.  But Nora's locket, that was a surprise.  And you saved me from that, so I suppose I should thank you.
[JUD419]Obrigado.
[JUD420]This is a choice you are making, Alex, not me.  If feeling more pain makes this transition easier for you, then by all means, I want to help you.
[JUD421]I want you to know that I don't take pleasure in this, Alex.  It's just the way things need to be done.  If I don't do it, who could I trust to do it right?  Lillian, she was useless.  Fitch, Bartlett. They were too weak.  You see?  There is only me now.
[JUD422]They do believe in me, Alex.  Because I believe in them.  I have something real now.  A chance to have faith again.
[JUD423]Oh, Alex.  I know you're a very brave young man.  You wanted to be a soldier, just like your father.  I can appreciate that.  But please don't misunderstand what's happening.  I'm not doing this to change your mind.
[JUD424]I'm doing this to take the life from your body.
[JUD425]Alex, please don't misunderstand what's happening.  I'm not doing this to change your mind.
[JUD426]I'm doing this to take the life from your body.
